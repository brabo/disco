README ts-i2c
-----------------

This example sets up a very basic LCD display on the DISCO
board and fills it with green.
After a keypress on the console the screen will go red.
From this moment on, pressing on the touchscreen will turn
the screen green and it will output coordinates on the console.

The stmpe811 example driver uses i2c to communicate with the
touchscreen.

This example is largely based on the lcd-serial example.
